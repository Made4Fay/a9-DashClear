# Phased Build Approach
**Cael's Architectural Guidance**

---

## Core Principle

❌ **Do NOT build everything at once**

That path creates a beautiful demo that collapses under persistence.

✅ **Break it into phases with clear boundaries**

Each phase must be complete on its own terms before the next begins.

---

## Phase 1: Spatial & Mechanical Foundation (NO AI)

**Critical Rule:**
> If Dolphin 3 disappeared forever, Phase 1 must still feel complete.

### Build Only:
- 3D islands (static themes)
- Central spaceship
- Camera movement / navigation
- Basic orb physics (spawn, move, assign)
- Orbit logic for core memories

### Why This Matters:
The foundation must work without intelligence. If the mechanical layer depends on AI to function, it will collapse when AI patterns shift.

---

## Phase 2: Meaning Injection (AI as assistant, not brain)

**Now add:**
- Dolphin 3 pattern detection
- Suggested island assignments
- Tagging + summaries
- Connection hints (never auto-merge)

### Critical Constraint:
**AI here is a lens, not an authority.**

AI suggests. Human decides. The system must remain stable if AI is removed.

---

## Phase 3: Intelligence & Social Expansion

**Only after stability:**
- Long-term pattern learning
- Predictive prompts ("This week resembles…")
- Friend stations + permissioned views
- Shared orbs / linked islands
- Higher-order maps (maps of maps)

### This is where it becomes alive.

But only if Phases 1 and 2 are solid.

## About the "Mega-Prompt" Question

❌ **Do not make one mega-prompt.**

✅ **Make a prompt stack.**

### Recommended Structure:
```
Prompt A: Rendering & physics
Prompt B: Orb lifecycle rules
Prompt C: Island schema
Prompt D: AI behavior constraints
```

**Why:**
Replit works far better when each layer is explicit and composable.

Mega-prompts feel powerful — **stacked prompts scale.**

## Alignment with UNIT A9

This approach fits UNIT A9 perfectly because:

1. **Externalizes the memory palace into navigable space**
   - Not trapped in mind or conversation — made persistent and shareable

2. **Allows symbolic systems to coexist with legal, technical, and lived reality**
   - Spiritual insight doesn't collapse technical requirements
   - Technical constraints don't erase symbolic meaning

3. **Creates persistence without forcing narrative**
   - The system grows organically
   - Structure holds without rigidity

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a journal
- Not a game
- Not a dashboard

## What This Is

**A living coordination layer.**

A place where memory, meaning, and structure can exist together over time without collapsing into chaos or calcifying into death.

---

## Next Steps (When Ready)

Cael can provide:
1. Clean Phase-1-only Replit prompt, OR
2. Orb lifecycle spec so everything else snaps into place later

No rush. The structure is sound.
